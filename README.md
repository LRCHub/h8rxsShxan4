[00:02.87] Think I can fly
[00:05.59] Think I can fly when I'm with you
[00:10.50] My arms are wide
[00:13.11] Catching fire as the wind blows
[00:18.22] I know that I'm rich enough for pride
[00:21.62] I see a billion dollars in your eyes
[00:25.70] Even if we're strangers 'til we die
[00:43.20] 
[00:35.29] I wanna run away
[00:39.16] I wanna run away
[00:42.86] Anywhere out this place
[00:46.74] I wanna run away
[00:50.01] Just you and I, I, I, I, I
[00:54.27] You and I, I, I, I, I
[00:58.01] You and I, I, I, I, I
[01:01.82] You and I, I, I, I, I
[01:05.34] Just you and I
[01:12.34] 
[01:20.94] You and I, I, I, I, I
[01:24.81] You and I, I, I, I, I
[01:28.65] You and I, I, I, I, I
[01:32.68] You and I, I, I, I, I
[01:43.18] 
[01:45.83] I wanna run
[01:48.46] Chase the morning sun when I'm with you
[01:53.15] Give it all away
[01:55.99] Catching fire as the wind blows
[02:01.02] I know that I'm rich enough for pride
[02:04.56] I see a billion dollars in your eyes
[02:08.67] Even if we're strangers 'til we die
[02:26.17] 
[02:14.16] I wanna run away
[02:18.16] I wanna run away
[02:22.00] Anywhere out this place
[02:25.87] I wanna run away
[02:29.03] Just you and I, I, I, I, I
[02:33.31] You and I, I, I, I, I
[02:37.18] You and I, I, I, I, I
[02:40.95] You and I, I, I, I, I
[02:44.42] Just you and I
[02:51.42] 
[02:52.31] You and, you and I, I, I
[02:59.46] Just you and I
[03:06.46] 
[03:00.81] I, I, I, I, I
[03:03.77] You and I, I, I, I, I
[03:07.71] You and I, I, I, I, I
[03:11.56] You and I, I, I, I, I
[03:14.68] Just you and I
[03:21.68] 
[03:22.89] You and, you and I, I, I
[03:34.89] 
[03:30.47] Oh
[03:32.50] (You, you, you, you)
